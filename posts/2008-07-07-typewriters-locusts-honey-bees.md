title: Typewriters, Locusts &amp; Honey Bee's
type: post
---

So I bought a typewriter for $13 at the Thrift store. There is something so
elegant about typewriters, they feel so soulful next to computers.

The faded locust faintly in the background of the text above is something I
drew today. After much searching I decided the closest opposite to the honey
bee is the locust. This is intreaguing, I've been thinking about locusts for
quite a while and never really made the symbolic comparison.

Locusts are the appitimy of the mob, the anti-comunity. Their behavior is
representative of destruction, chaos and hedonism. They breed madly, and
consume everything in their path, and when the land bears nothing left to
consume they move on.

The honey bee is the appitamy of the group effort, the communist ideal. They
are representative of creation, order, and the collective good. They coexist
with their surroundings, and propagate life around them. They are selfless,
and are dedicated towards the survival of the entire colony.

Although honey bees may seem the more virtuous of the two, their really the
same... both just trying to survive and following the evolutionary models set
out for them to do so. These two models obviously are intended to be applied
to humanity, where their meaning becomes more real. The world thrives on both
creation and destruction. The community as a whole can be bettered just as
much from a selfish individual, as a selfless one. The key is that both are
necessary. I dedicate my life towards intention. I wish for everything in my
life, good and bad, be directed with will, and choice. An individual who
wishes to live their life with intention, I believe must embrace both creation
and destruction. Both hedonism, and selflessness. Both order, and chaos. In
order to feel fufilled and complete as an individual, I believe one must
possess both the mentality the honey bee and the locust.
