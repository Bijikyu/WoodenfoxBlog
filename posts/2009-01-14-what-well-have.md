title: What We'll Have
---



I've built us a cathedral from sandwich toothpicks,  
Sipping tea, stuffing soggy envelopes that seal themselves,  
I sent the mayoed pickles to refugees.

'sigh'  
Forbid they be an aquired taist!  
For fear my fickle fancys request they send them back to me.  
Let's jest, be poor...

Til' you and I might swim as ducks,  
Side by side, to catch the crumbs  
In our one dollar bills.

~Mike Messenger
