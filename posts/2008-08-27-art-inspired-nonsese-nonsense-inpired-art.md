Dunking Donut f*ck  
I can't remember a time I forgot something that hurt.  
What's the best formula for disaster  
I'm plasterd with a casting line of fish nets  
Set to suck me into the water wet,  
Dreams of empty pie tins crumpled  
Lie down to your steam  
Fume when the crown comes around,  
Get your turn to be  
Captain America.

Everyone says he's dead.  
Not Nietzsche, god made short work of him long before he could.  
But we all believe he's alive...  
Someone will draw the straw scribed "Judas"  
We'll all close one eye while they pen n' shade his rebirth

Finish what you've begun.
