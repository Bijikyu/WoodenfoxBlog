I've been camping by the ocean for too long.  
The sand's cracked my feet and the sun's too hot.  
It's epiphany, not love, that ties me to the bedpost  
It was my dreams that tightened the knot,  
I can't stop.

I finally found what has been keeping men and women apart,  
Its that line between them on signs for restroom doors,  
I peeled one off while grinning in symbolic satisfaction,  
God patted me on the back and parentally shook his head.

I am an Astronaut,  
Wasted on vodka a billion miles from the earth.  
The government tells me I failed the Rorschach ink blot  
I told the doctors I saw two men holding hands.

I think a penny is all I need to pay back my debt to you,  
Understand it's more of a gesture, not to be thought of as quantifiable,  
I understand it may come off as a big "Fuck You," but thats up to you.  
You could choose to keep it and remember me always.

My perception of color is no longer what I was taught,  
I keep thinking blue when I see red,  
It's just not the same watching movies where people get shot,  
It all just looks... absurd.

Alright God, I name the last dumb animal "Zebra," where is my Eve?
