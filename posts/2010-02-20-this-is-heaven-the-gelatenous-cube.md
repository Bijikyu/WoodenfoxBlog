Somehow I've escaped the world between firm perceptions  
(That gray mass of questions and misdirections.)  
I've lived in the gelatinous cube and survived...  
Now I'm nude, armor left behind.

I don't know about you, but fantasy and lucid dreams have created me.  
My ego has grown to the size of Leonardo Divinci's metaphorical balls.  
I actually have the gall to believe I can do anything.

I've been blowing bubbles between 9 hour shifts, naps and dreams.  
I love what I do, and the question now is who am I in-between.

I love this little thing we call life,  
I don't know where I'm going but I've convinced myself it's forward.  
I miss the silence of singlehood,  
But I love the love of a lover.

I think this world were in is heaven,  
Hell is any voice in our heads that tells us otherwise.
