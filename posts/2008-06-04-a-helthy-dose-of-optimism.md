"This is just the beginning," Margie exasperated, "Why do you have to be so
glum Gerald, talking about us like we've been together for years," her fists
rest on her hips as she stares at him, her face holding back a slight grin.

"Hey! I'm just telling you the mistakes we'll probably make together." His
sheepish smile bores unbearably into her resisting smile, "I mean, our kids
are probably going to be lunatics--"

"No... the only lunatic in our family, that is if we have a family together,
is you smart guy. Our children are going to be happy and perfect."

Gerald kicks at a passing sand castle and shivers for a moment as they both
look up to see the last sliver of the sun blink out. "Well, I guess there's no
hope for them being depressed freaks like me then," he pulls her a little
closer so she can feel his body shake against hers.

"That's why I love you Gerald... because I think your a depressed-- are you
cold? Its seventy five degrees out here Gerald!" she says with a worrying
glare.

"You can continue, I believe you were about to explain the real reason your
still with me after a world record, five dates--"

"Well firstly I wouldn't call them dates," her hands tickle his side
aggressively, " You haven't spent a dime on me, and secondly, yes, I already
have Guinness on the phone," She puts her pinkie to her chin and her thumb to
her ear, "Wait, there telling me they don't believe me, they want us to wait
right here until their camera crew arrives." He slides his hand from her far
shoulder slowly up the arch of her neck, and steps abruptly in front of her
putting their faces only inches apart. He lets her feel his warm breath on her
lips, but then moves up and gives her a soft peck on the nose. "Your such a
tease Gerald," she places both of hands on his chest softly, leans in as if to
give a kiss and then pushes him firmly away. He trips and falls backward the
heals of his palms dig into the the soft sand. He looks up at her with a huge
grin on his face and grabs her by the leg and pulls her down with him.
