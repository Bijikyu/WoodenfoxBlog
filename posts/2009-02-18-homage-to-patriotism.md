title: Homage to Patriotism
---



The American Flag hangs over my desk for the first time,  
It's wrinkled and missing a few stars.

There was a empty pang in my stomach while hanging it.  
My social awareness of white pride, rural rednecks implied...  
Last time I felt pride... I was a republican.  
It's been a decade... since I changed sides.

I guess I'm allowed to be proud now.  
And I've been trying on that feeling for fit.  
But Nationalism still has that funky smell.

So my reservations hold... like barnacles on a ship  
Trying to find the imaginary numbers keeping us afloat.  
Asking myself... which is more patriotic:  
A hammer... or a gun.

~Mike Messenger
