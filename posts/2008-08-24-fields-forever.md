Savoring ideas  
My finger runs across the splinter grained wood,  
Wet dirt from a summer hose wafts by in a gust of air,  
The burst of a cold strawbery, the solid cold grasping teath  
Desert lips moist citrus sting soothing...  
The hours tenderized souls of feet crossed rock dirt  
Preasure clentchd fists open forward grabbing wind  
Damp palms catch crisp breeze  
Harvesting treasures red.
