                    <p>Carve out your places in life.</p>

<p>Burrow in the cracks and crevices where inspiration grows,</p>

<p>Open the mountains and mine the estuaries of thought and diligence reserved,</p>

<p>Catch the drifting threads.</p>

<p>Wind caught scents that swirl and catch, absorb and fill the dry,</p>

<p>Soak the thoughts that catch, clouds of mist that rise and leave one fresh in
worlds of white</p>

<p>These are dreams that catch, that feed and thrive,</p>

<p>These are the oligarchies of minds edge, tripping over forgotten sensations,
those that wake and lift.</p>

<p>Bottle them as fireflies, but care to feed, and free, and trust they will
return on winters and summers eve.</p>

<p>As the cold and the warm are simply coins of thought, which thrive on one
another.</p>

Are we critics of critics, or authors of our own opinions?</p>

Until a dreamer invents the next microscope.</p>

                    <p>Somehow I've escaped the world between firm perceptions <br />
(That gray mass of questions and misdirections.) <br />
I've lived in the gelatinous cube and survived... <br />
Now I'm nude, armor left behind.</p>

<p>I don't know about you, but fantasy and lucid dreams have created me. <br />
My ego has grown to the size of Leonardo Divinci's metaphorical balls. <br />
I actually have the gall to believe I can do anything.</p>

<p>I've been blowing bubbles between 9 hour shifts, naps and dreams. <br />
I love what I do, and the question now is who am I in-between.</p>

<p>I love this little thing we call life, <br />
I don't know where I'm going but I've convinced myself it's forward. <br />
I miss the silence of singlehood, <br />
But I love the love of a lover.</p>

<p>I think this world were in is heaven, <br />
Hell is any voice in our heads that tells us otherwise.</p>

It's Christmas <br />
Its color was brown <br />
It's my turn to drive <br />
Its tiny hand held mine <br />
It's the reason we're together <br />
We're alone finally <br />
Were you happy?</p>

<p>Just practicing my: it's / its / were / we're grammar. I was writing with
stream of consciousness, didn't realize it was a poem until much later.</p>

                    <p>While my responsibility drives, <br />
Shouting obscenities at passersbys, <br />
I'm in the back seat, window down <br />
Air surfing with my hand.</p>

<p>I'm ball dancing through a window, <br />
With a twist, our cupped hands made fist, <br />
We waltz through glass shards shimmering <br />
Air treading on obliviousness.</p>

<p>I've got mud on my helmet, bugs in my teeth, <br />
Built a pyramid of cars named Mona, <br />
Tearing monster truck tires up that staircase, <br />
Past heaven, into outer-space.</p>

<p>Forget coins in my eyes, currency is yet to be invented in this fantasy, <br />
The gate keeper best get himself a dictionary before the jury arrives, <br />
I'm a silver tongued lawyer for my soul, <br />
Grifting for just a few extra lives.</p>

                    <p>I've spun the marry-go-round hard. <br />
Wrapped my legs around the bars, <br />
Trusting momentum, back to the air <br />
My arms flayed, chest to the sun. <br />
Vision blurred, head in the stars. <br />
What I haven't done to feel.</p>

<p>We're the cradle generation, <br />
Ladle up the alphabet soup. <br />
Rock stars of our imaginary worlds, <br />
Pebbles and moons in our cereal, <br />
Life's just too hard. <br />
Holding hands with hedonism.</p>

<p>It wasn't meaningful enough for me. <br />
I sought the satisfaction of abuse, <br />
Still got bruises from human roller coasters <br />
Boredom induced masochism. <br />
Finally I called, "Truce!"</p>

<p>I'm done with Ego masturbation, <br />
Convenience based morality, <br />
Procrastination, Isolation, <br />
Games with human names.</p>

<p>Starting from the ground up, <br />
Lets build something.</p>

                    <p>The American Flag hangs over my desk for the first time, <br />
It's wrinkled and missing a few stars.</p>

<p>There was a empty pang in my stomach while hanging it. <br />
My social awareness of white pride, rural rednecks implied... <br />
Last time I felt pride... I was a republican. <br />
It's been a decade... since I changed sides.</p>

<p>I guess I'm allowed to be proud now. <br />
And I've been trying on that feeling for fit. <br />
But Nationalism still has that funky smell.</p>

<p>So my reservations hold... like barnacles on a ship <br />
Trying to find the imaginary numbers keeping us afloat. <br />
Asking myself... which is more patriotic: <br />
A hammer... or a gun.</p>

                    <p>If I'm to be between <br />
The world in my head. <br />
And the world as we collectively see it. <br />
So be it.</p>

<p>I've got a barefoot on the one foot, <br />
And I've a misfit tube sock too tight on the two foot <br />
What's mass-produced is too loose, or tight <br />
My mommy was only an assembly line for two. <br />
To me that's just right.</p>

<p>Princesses, popes, petty prim coats, and the past... <br />
Cut &amp; pasting palaces round people, some with moats &amp; crocodiles, <br />
Given enough time and glue, make-believe just never lasts... <br />
People put their hopes in odd places</p>

<p>We're so much more then we Play-Doh ourselves to be. <br />
Da Vinci might of got close though, <br />
I'm on the fifth shelf. <br />
Too short to reach myself.</p>

<p>I know with a camera zoom out to fit the size of existence, <br />
We may just be ten tin men setup in a row <br />
Just waiting for a finger to let us go <br />
I am the finger of my perception.</p>

<p>In my lucid dream's I've been granted god's hand <br />
Levitation, creation, the desires of anyman <br />
I've had a thousand tan brunets, <br />
Even... Triplets</p>

<p>My next challenge--a clone of myself <br />
Though facsimiles have been made, sentience alludes me <br />
Some part of me resists granting total control <br />
In due time, I'll summon this world of mine.</p>

Huntched... curled into a shadow. <br />
In a black coffin. <br />
In a insane stupor, he cradled it <br />
Pieced it back to gather again <br />
Its golden body in his arms, <br />
Only to let it sing in ways he could not remember <br />
Notes falling daffidly failing with moments of udder bliss, <br />
A mixed concerto of rediscovery, failures and sucess, <br />
Its brilliance shined, and for a moment, <br />
Two were one. <br />
A gasp of release, and with a brief flurry of afterthoughts, <br />
It was in pieces again, <br />
With little absolute reassurances of return. <br />
And it sits, in the corner <br />
Again waiting for its memorance, <br />
To be struck on by insanity. <br />
Beautiful, <br />
If only, one could take on such bliss, <br />
While reasonable, and sane.</p>

                    <p>We connoisseurs of fantasy <br />
Who dress in different destinies and dreams <br />
How we love to... <br />
Imagine.</p>

<p>Myself is only tangible <br />
With four fingers <br />
Clinging to the cliff of identity <br />
My mirror, memories <br />
And reflections in others eyes</p>

<p>One finger fatigued <br />
Reaches bent broken to the air <br />
Wind brushes across <br />
Whispering truths and lies <br />
To the persisting four:</p>

<p>You can become anything, <br />
Now two flail towards the sun. <br />
You're what you believe, <br />
A claw mark is left behind. <br />
Options are infinite, <br />
A puff of dust. Only one clings. <br />
You can never loose yourself, <br />
My body tumbles through the air.</p>

<p>When I meet someone new <br />
Through them I'm self aware <br />
Not of my immaculate illusion, <br />
But who I've become.</p>

<p>While I and those I love have held four fingers <br />
Firmly pressing my actions to fit <br />
Sun warped puzzle pieces of previous perception <br />
And fantasize finding ourselves finished <br />
Some day.</p>

<p>In a world where the inanimate is alive <br />
And people are never the same <br />
We pretend the river is still. <br />
Perhaps we're less malleable then my mind believes <br />
But believing is better <br />
Perhaps.</p>

<p>If there is no end to my fall <br />
Am I doomed or have I discovered? <br />
How it feels to fly. <br />
To brace or embrace oneself.</p>

Done it all so far with my own hair. <br />
The true finesse was done with the beard I only this year learned to grow. <br />
A few horse hair brushes would have been nice-- and a real canvas, <br />
But Mona Lisa would practically paint her self with those tools.</p>

<p>I know myself like a tired lover, <br />
Who knows his partners thoughts before his own. <br />
Sometimes I just look at myself knowingly, and don't say anything at all.</p>

                    <p>A small piece of paper I found on this journey
Tonight was a bit odd. In a small world… revolutionary kind of way. I decided to go on a bike ride and open my mind a little because it has been a little too focused as of late and a evening of distraction seemed appropriate.</p>

<p>I rode my newly repaired bike (New tire and tube $9) down town, along the San Lorenzo river, and to Costco just in time to catch the last half hour of snack time. Beyond tortellini and miscellaneous sports drink samples, I starvingly snagged a piece of pizza, and had an Arnold Palmer (1/2 Ice Tea / 1/2 Lemonade) for 59 cents.</p>

<p>I wanted to go up the trail to UCSC and followed the hap-hazard directions of a guy with a bike who looked like the type who knew what he was talking about. The strong chinned type, like me. Anyway, he was an idiot and sent me up he homeless highway railroad tracks where I ended up having a lively conversation with a pair of pale moon bearded homeless men. After rattling my way up the gravel railroad for fifteen minutes, I aborted mission. I rationalized that there was nothing at UCSC I haven’t already seen and peddled a back sadly.</p>

<p>On my return journey I remembered a two lane bike road that winds up to Mission from Costco that I had eyed deviously in the past, contemplating if I could get away with driving my car up it despite the “Bicycle and Pedestrians Only Sign.” I decided I needed to scout it out for width before any such endeavor would be attempted, and this bike journey would be an excellent time to do so. Just as I turned the corner back towards Costco I saw people congregating outside a building. I saw a sign that said above… “The Fellowship.” And assuming it was merely a cult gathering or Lord of the Rings fan club I proceeded.</p>

<p>I walked up to the friendliest looking gentleman, a bald shrived man, and asked what was going on.</p>

<p>“Its the fellowship,” he said.
“Yah. I see.”
“Yah.”
“So what’s the fellowship ?”
“A.A.”
“Oh.”
“They won’t make you say anything if you go in there. And there’s free…” <em>Zelda music played mysteriously in the air</em> “…coffee and donuts”
“Really? So I don’t have to introduce myself or anything? Hi my name is Mike and I’m just pretending to be an alcoholic?”
“No,” he said gravely as if my denial made my case all the more serous.</p>

<p>I went in and decided the best way to fit in would be to immediately pour myself a coffee, which I did. The donuts would be for next time. I sat as they read the twelve steps and the twelve traditions. I listened to the guest speaker for the day, while gingerly sipping my coffee. I fell in love with the traditions on the wall silently while he recounted the tragic things that had occurred to him while he was sober, and how people who knew about his problem swarmed to his side to distract and help him through it. He made jokes like “they ate all the food in my fridge, and mostly just watched the football season on my TV, but I couldn’t thank those guys enough for being there.” He had it all. 19 out of the 20 signs of being an alcoholic. The only one that didn’t apply was ‘Have you ever lost a job’ from drinking. He said he never had a real job. He said his easiest days were when he helped someone else, those were the days he never is tempted. His involvement with the organization, sponsoring others had made him stronger. A big part of his story was about his first relationship after giving up drinking. Its a general rule (none of the rules are mandatory), that you don’t become involved in relationship until you’ve maintained one full year of sobriety. His sponsor told him he needed three. On his third year he met a woman and fell in love. His sponsor told him “Give me a call when it doesn’t work out,” he already knew.</p>

<p>While other people told their stories, I spent the whole time coming up with my own alcoholic story, entwining the already absurd truthful events in my life with carefully placed lies. I decided in the end my alcoholic admission would have to wait until I had ample time to solidify details. I like to keep my story constant. Throughout each persons story I also tried to apply the lessons in a more general sense. There speaking about addiction. Compulsion. Things which I myself have been very interested in, and perhaps overly psychologically aware of in the last five or six years. How does one get trapped. How does one let go of everything else in order to hold onto one thing. I’ve experienced this two or three times myself in my lifetime. I’ve feared getting trapped my whole life.</p>

<p>I thought about the structure of a completely anonymous group with no leadership. I thought about God. “Stick a fork in a light switch if that’s what it takes to believe in something greater then you.” I remember the speaker rumbling after a short story about atheism in his life.</p>

<p>At the end we held hands in a circle and said the Serenity Prayer. The last thing we said with a final two squeezes of the hands was, “Come back.” And that was it. I grabbed some literature… knowing deep down that I could probably find everything on the internet later. At the same time I wanted to take something physically away with me to remember. So I did. I chatted with a couple of the guys and rode off. Onwards towards my future driving trail. I found out they meet five times a day, every day of the week.</p>

<p>Just before the trail began there was a painted sign that said Table Tennis. I admit I partially believed, out of its utter absurdity, that this was merely a cover for some secret spy organization. I set to investigate. Sure enough, as I walked in there were nine or so tables set up and people were playing… ping pong. A guy at the door greeted me and said it was five smackers to play and I smiled and replied sweetly, “Can I just watch?” After twenty or so minutes I started hearing rumors stirring and began asking questions. It seemed that several out of towners were coming tonight for a sort of, impromptu tournament. The number 9 in the world Men’s 30’s champion was going to be there. Ranked 18 in the world overall. I sat and chatted with an older woman about technique as the pro’s arrived and put on there sporty short shorts and began to play. My life felt completely like Forest Gump at this point, having had so many absurd things happen in such a short span of time, and I smiled while imagining Gump carrying Lieutenant Dan out of Vietnam screaming “Put me down, let me die god damn it.” A flashback of Lieutenant Dan shouting curses at god on the top of the mast of the ship during a storm lit up in my head. I suddenly realized what I thought was these guys playing, was actually just warm ups, as they each threw down their ping pong balls and <em>poof</em> turned into ninjas.</p>

<p>I was wrong about ninjas… they held the ball like a wizards preparing fireball spells. They clutched it, stared furiously while rolling it in there fingers, turned their backs to there opponents and sliced their paddles like katanas sending the ball perfectly lofting centimeters above the net. Counter intuitively, there volleys grew shorter as they became more serious. Each round was a fencing match, a few swings, a subtle feint, the tip of the blade touched the torso, and its a point. The finesse, especially the delicate posturing, and the identical replication of motion during their serves was astounding. I was hypnotized for at least an hour.</p>

<p>I managed finally to draw my self away, not without finding out that the building was available MWF for rent fo $65 an hour. Perhaps fodder for a later scheme I pondered. I decided to ride to the baseball fields just for fun. While checking out the buildings as I rode past, one was filled with people laughing and my curiosity took hold again. This evening is pure madness I thought! Again… but still… it is pure genius.</p>

<p>I was brave and walked up to the door and peaked in, the guy at the head of the room was obviously doing some sort of show, and he looked at me and beckoned me forward. I sat quietly and realized he was preforming… believe it or not… a magic show. I looked at the audience and noticed it was mostly kids. They were half American, and based on the chatter I deduced, half Japanese. The magician was a god. He had the mustache. He had the rabbits! At one point after removing a rabbit from a cake he subtly turned his back to the audience and wiped it down as it had obviously been in the cake for a little longer then small rabbit blatters could handle. He even did this with panache. His shtick was clever. He pretended to be a bad magician. His tricks of choice all appeared to be obvious, but there was always a twist.</p>

<p>At the end I was very curious as to what exactly I had walked into, and talked to the lady who seemed the most obviously in charge. She had been translating some of the more complicated parts in Japanese. She told me it was a group that worked with kids in conjunction with Santa Cruz’s sister city in Japan. That the kids were doing a sort of “after school exchange program.” Very interesting I thought. I know someone who’s very interested in something very similar I said. My free magic show was over, I could very well tell that unlike AA they would not be sharing there Pizza, so I departed. I rode back along the trail I’d been headed for all along and decided a small clown car could navigate on it perfectly but not my own. The air was icy as I burned down the road with only a white t-shirt all the way home.</p>

<p>With courage and finesse we can live as foxes.</p>

                    <p>I found this, poem/narrative that I wrote six months ago and in retrospect I
think it think it provides some perspective into the feelings I was having at
that time. The title to this post is a line from another poem written a week
or two before. This narrative is a transition out of that state of mind. This
is un-edited from the original. It was written as a stream of conciousness
poem/narrative originally with no edits on the page, and I feel this is the
form it must be presented in.</p>

<p>I don't know why, but I felt compelled to read this aloud with spoken word the
instant I found it. I only read it once in my head before recording it spoken
aloud and you can hear my own perspective change of how the piece should be
read as I re-read it. The second part I did not choose to speak aloud.  </p>

<p>Part I</p>

<p>Sometimes I make so many mistakes</p>

<p>It becomes who I am. <br />
How am I not myself. <br />
I am everything I do, and it's only <br />
Hard for me, <br />
When I don't know how to repair what <br />
I have destroyed.</p>

<p>I am lost in happenstance <br />
Drowned in a hazy fog of repressed thought. <br />
Complex fear, and delusion.</p>

<p>All the same I feel so clear and lucid. <br />
A lucidity so crystalline, <br />
so pure and sterile, I feel cold.</p>

<p>Its difficult to accept when one <br />
Has tried too hard. When ones <br />
Intentions have trespassed, and <br />
Swallowed the intuitiveness that <br />
Created the dreams my intentions <br />
Strive for.</p>

<p>Part II</p>

<p>I am a host to devils, and I do not even believe they exist.</p>

<p>Why must others be the lens from which I must filter truth.</p>

<p>I pick up my own marionette strings and cast myself into a frenzied dance. <br />
No one dances, <br />
On the page, in type, in songs and in fables is the only place. <br />
In the real world it is forgotten. <br />
Music is something for private ears, <br />
Its important to capture your emotion, <br />
While it is hot. <br />
While it is cold. <br />
While it is fresh. <br />
While it is empty.</p>

<p>Smile a little while you cry. <br />
There are some options which are never the right answer.</p>

                    <p>A steady trickle of courage leaks from an infinite dam, <br />
Moving through the dry heaving cracks of this nation, <br />
Saturating the minds of children and aspiring world leaders, <br />
Nourishing intellect, community, and self expression.Could we be so brave? <br />
Could we choose the people of the world as our own blood? <br />
Could pipe-dreams lead to the sweet beaches of Turkey? <br />
Metaphorical Perfection, I ask thee, "Can man survive in your world?" <br />
Can a man who dedicates his live to change, ever be content? <br />
Do kind people really get the better deal in the end? <br />
Or is that just what everyone else wants them to believe? <br />
"I clasped my heart in my hands to you Metaphorical Perfection."</p>

<p>When my brain implodes inwards, <br />
I can see the moment of my death through the optic nerve of my extricated eye <br />
I don't want to be remembered in ten foot tall print. <br />
I wish to be whispered about, passed secretly under desks, <br />
To live in smirks, and winks, and secret handshakes, <br />
Not in spirit, or blood, But in life, humanity itself.</p>

                    <p>I escaped TV land to the streets with my new found geek companions. My Rolodex
was full of numbers the potentialist inside me screamed to possess but I'd
likely never call. As we treaded to Nintendo World a memory bubble played a
segment from my own childhood. This is exactly the kind of place I would have
dreamed of when I was twelve on family vacation and begged my father to visit
only to arrive with it closed for renovation. I couldn't help but tell every
twelve year old child I passed that less then a mile away existed a life sized
virtual reality chamber where "You too can stomp goombas and eat magic
mushrooms!" I could paint a picture of every mothers grimace.</p>

<p>It was pretty much twenty stories tall and I wandered as Link for two hours in
a real life representation of Hyrule. The balance board is fun too, I got a
perfect score in the surfing game, and now have the confidence to take waves
as tall as the Nintendo building. I'll be buying my real life surfboard with
my next paycheck. To be honest, I wanted to get out on my own again. I could
tell the guy from Wisconsin was a bit nervous with me around his girlfriend,
which makes sense... he knew she was obviously my type. So I kicked it after
lunch, after having a fight with some Time Square pizza jerks who tried to
charge me $50 for a slice I thought was only $30. I grabbed my bags, stole
some more cookies, and turned on my biological supercomputer to figure out the
NY Subway system.<a href="http://www.woodenfox.com/wp-
content/uploads/2008/07/WorshipSub.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl
}}/assets/2008/07/WorshipSub.jpg" alt="" /></a>NY Subway Worship</p>

<p>Imagine re-entering your mothers womb. Of course... huge, cement and filled
with many other people trying to do the same thing. The New York Subway
possess all the grit, damp, steaming, burning sweaty air of a sauna with its
bench on fire. Flailing, towel waving old men and all. It is so symbolic of
New York, there is a entire religion dedicated to its worship, and felt as if
I had just been inducted. A masochists dream, the suffering which occurs
before your A, B, 1, 2 or three arrives is legendary, lucky for all you
sadists out their the misery is shared by all. When it pulls to a stop and the
doors slide open it is reminiscent of stepping into a mountain lake at 10,000
feet. A flood of cool air pours out and crawls up your arms, neck, and with a
shiver finally over your head. Everything moves fast. I with a 50 pound pack
filled with useless cold weather cloths strapped to my back, sent people
toppling over in piles like bowling pins with every turn. The subway is
amazing. I absolutely love it.</p>

<p>Upon exiting and coming to the surface from what felt like a teleporter,
conception of distance traveled could only be measured in the change in the
people and scenery around me. "Union Square" this was the home of the True New
Yorker, I could feel it boiling my blood. Everything was real, and alive. It
possessed all the spirit and soul Time Square lacked. <br />
<a href="http://www.woodenfox.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/GIANT-FOX-
UNION-SQUARE-copy.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2008/07/GIANT-FOX-UNION-SQUARE-

<p>Union Square, 16 Story Fox</p>

<p>I engendered a endless, but beautiful walk to my hostel for the night.
Arriving only to find it's width to be approximate to my arms reach. I
deposited my pack, and set out to make my possessions look as worthless as
possible, placing my ratty green shoes on the pillow, and various wrappers,
trash and distractions to encourage anyone curious to believe my bag did not
happen to contain my 17" Sony laptop. I could hear people outside wailing in
such a way that could only be the result of a sixteen-story fox consuming them
one by one, but was focused in my task. One of my soon to be eight roommates,
a portly man with a full size keyboard cellphone informed me as to a bar where
every drink gets you free pizz... and without even finishing his sentence I
had departed to acquire some.</p>

<p>The Gator Bar. Impressive. The bartender wore a flat brimmed hat, huge black
sideburns, a nose of legendary proportions, a runway goatee, and a styled
greased mustache. He was Cyrano De Bergerac incarnate and if not with his
arms, but with his smile, he could obviously wrestle an an alligator. <br />

copy.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The Impressive Bartender</p>

<p>I ordered a some SlyFox from the tap, a brilliant ale. Within a few minutes an
full bodied orchestra played a micro-symphony as my pizza arrived, but
immediately cut off as the plate hit the table. The thick amber ale and pie
satisfied my body while conversation with locals satisfied my mind. We all
came to the conclusion that my act on television was merely a drop in the
machine fueling the numbing, dumbing, down of America, and it was acts like
these that get people like Bush into office. They were brassy, crass, and had
an ounce of sass. They were all manners of ass, and I loved them.</p>

<p>The timbre of my type is growing dissonant... to be continued.</p>

                    <p>I just saw Michael the Archangel, and was incredibly moved… I’ll cheat and steal a picture by someone else to give you an idea of how fucking awesome this is.I’ve always had a soft spot for Angels with swords, that I happen to be named after. I was sitting in Starbucks trying to remember the name of the church its in front of and asked an old Jewish guy next to me. He said, “Ya, I know what your talkin’ about, its Saint Johns Cathedral, Michael’s got his foot on ‘you know who’s head,'” For anyone who’s familiar with the representation, you’ll like what he added on here at the end. “You know who… George Bush.” This makes me love New York even more. I’ve been shooting the shit with locals this whole trip and I have to admit, they’re fucking great.</p>

<p>I was on TV today. Since I don’t watch TV, I was able to watch through the wonders of the internet, you can watch the segment below. I admit I was a little nervous, but not nearly as much as Joyce who did great by the way (She had no idea they were going to play the montage at the beginning about her, surprise!). I had to be brave to inspire geek courage amongst my fellows. I find this is usually when I’m the most brave. Below is a picture of the people we worked with. The girl on the far right is the producer, next Dan the guy who proposed and organized the segment, followed by the cute couple from Wisconsin (we went to the Nintendo World store, and gorged on pizza afterward), then theirs Joyce on the end.
My ego couldn’t help but cut and paste this blurb Joyce wrote on her blog:</p>

<p>“Then I met Mike from Santa Cruz. He was handsome, funny and had awesome green sneakers. Effortlessly he epitomized everything we love about geekdom. I guess that is why they picked him. People kept saying to him….you won’t be single long! I certainly hope that is true. 🙂 … Mike was just the right amount of smart/smartass. I love him. ” ~JoyceWell… anyway, here’s the shit you’ve been waiting for. Funny thing is, this part of the trip was probably the least exciting part: The segment!I’ll figure out how to get this posted on my blog when I get back, and I’m not in the best city on earth.
There’s a ton more I have no time to describe about my trip, and sadly there will be no pictures to share. I need to hire a bard to travel with me and log my epic journeys in song. More to come. Tonight is the CouchSurfer slumber party on Long Island, lets hope I can navigate the Subways all the way there!</p>

                    <p>The experience which is NY.</p>

<p>I could recount the events of my trip, with poetic pondering, slightly exaggerated elaborations, and deliberated dissections. Instead I will write a fiction. Because inherently all perceptions are fictions, and every retelling is a recreation.</p>

<p>I was picked up at my doorstep by a ten foot tall mustached man driving a Benz built by Romans. This man had a mouth as big as he was tall and an array of skills to match. He felt like a victim from Los Angeles washed up and resuscitated on kinder shores. With dreams of movie sets, he bragged at his capacity to get things done, his grandest achievement, “Key Grip,” whatever that is. He was California. And as he smiled huge, gave me his card in hopes that someday my fame would cary him on the wave he’d been training to surf his whole life. I loved him. And as I waved goodbye to him, California waved back.</p>

<p>I’d go into the cavity searches which occurred while going through security, but I feel this is a trodden subject which has been over portrayed. So imagine for yourself the exaggerations you’ve heard a hundred times and lets move on.</p>

<p>As I sat waiting to depart, I searched the crowds for the “True New Yorker,” as I shall call him or her. I knew one must have been lured to the greener oceans of California and would be returning home on my same flight. The True New Yorker would be in a weakened state from the softening effect of this place, and would be ripe for capture. My eyes crawled out of my scull and wandered across the laps of strangers, my words slithering into ears in efforts to root out this creature. But as a social butterfly I was unsatisfied, and decided to introvert into my book at the thought of the ridiculousness of seeking something I would be immersed in shortly.</p>

<p>The sky over New York as you arrive in the night is like Gods private Light Bright set. Organized in grids of perfection which could only arise from years of destruction and recreation. It was an ocean that formed a net made of gold. In the midst I caught a glimpse of the ever so familiar red and blue drifting down the streets strobeing in majestic contrast. To save someones life? Or the hand of our Executive branch?</p>

<p>Upon arrival a generic foreigner, who classically described that his family would be coming shortly, drove me to the neon alter of corporate human sacrifice, “Times Square.” I was taken aback, and immediately felt subliminally compelled to purchase at least eighteen different products. I managed to escape my stupor and ascend to my room in the Quadruple Tree hotel only to be disappointed with my rooms height, looking out only 100 feet over the city. I ate the cookie I was given at the desk, quite a prize for a $300 room, and savored its freeness.</p>

<p>I wandered the streets, asking again, “Where was the true New Yorker?” Not here. Just idiots like me. I managed to find myself in back ally bars. The kind of bars where your back pressed against the wall, and your stomach was pinned to the counter. The kind of bars where newcomers crawled under the gauntlet of bar stools to find a seat. The drink was good. I just enjoyed, and listened. They must be here.</p>

<p>I opened my eyes only to find myself reading a sheet of typed notes. I was at Fox News? It was comfortable like a red harem filled with pillows, and as I read the lines I had spoken in my phone interview I thought to myself, “Shit… no wonder I’m here.” I knew the only person who could set the bar too high would be myself. I had no idea how to remember all the clever phrases I’d used. I instead took the famous phrase “be your self” literally, and decided to say “Fuck it, I’ll improve.” I’d put myself in the mind frame that everyone around me were mere peasants and with my fellow geeks shivering I had to be strong for us all.</p>

<p>There was one line in my head that I wanted to use, should the moment arrive. Sure enough it did. And it was the kicker of the whole show. I imagine as the moment took place a sign lit up for the audience saying “Boooooo” but they payed no regard and hooted and hollered over it. I even got her to wear my glasses.</p>

<p>After stealing several platters of egg burrito, I exited a champion. People looked authentically intimidated by me. I guess its dangerous to declare your disinterest in blond talk show hosts. But I felt the geeks had won. I thought it was absolutely important that everyone know, we have formed a geek dating site because we are superior, and don’t wish to waist our time with superficial blond talk show hosts.</p>

<p>I can see z’s escaping my head. To be continued…</p>

                    <p class='card-text'><small class='text-muted'>July 07, 2008 at 04:03</small></p>
                    <p>So I bought a typewriter for $13 at the Thrift store. There is something so
elegant about typewriters, they feel so soulful next to computers.</p>

<p>The faded locust faintly in the background of the text above is something I
drew today. After much searching I decided the closest opposite to the honey
bee is the locust. This is intreaguing, I've been thinking about locusts for
quite a while and never really made the symbolic comparison.</p>

<p>Locusts are the appitimy of the mob, the anti-comunity. Their behavior is
representative of destruction, chaos and hedonism. They breed madly, and
consume everything in their path, and when the land bears nothing left to
consume they move on.</p>

<p>The honey bee is the appitamy of the group effort, the communist ideal. They
are representative of creation, order, and the collective good. They coexist
with their surroundings, and propagate life around them. They are selfless,
and are dedicated towards the survival of the entire colony.</p>

<p>Although honey bees may seem the more virtuous of the two, their really the
same... both just trying to survive and following the evolutionary models set
out for them to do so. These two models obviously are intended to be applied
to humanity, where their meaning becomes more real. The world thrives on both
creation and destruction. The community as a whole can be bettered just as
much from a selfish individual, as a selfless one. The key is that both are
necessary. I dedicate my life towards intention. I wish for everything in my
life, good and bad, be directed with will, and choice. An individual who
wishes to live their life with intention, I believe must embrace both creation
and destruction. Both hedonism, and selflessness. Both order, and chaos. In
order to feel fufilled and complete as an individual, I believe one must
possess both the mentality the honey bee and the locust.</p>

                    <p>There's no love at first sight for computer geeks. It use to be that a man
looked for a woman with a particular set of skills, that was generally
expected for all women to have, and a woman looked for a reliable man who
would work hard to earn money to raise a family. Even with these unfair gender
standards, people had a hard time finding the right person. Now lets ask
ourselves, how hard is it to find a girl who can write code in Linux? Because
that's an example of a set of skills I'd be interested in, and that represents
probably ten girls in California, none of which I would meet on the street.
Online dating is an inevitability for the nerd community. And from my
observations a potentially successful one. Congrats Brian &amp; Leah! Love at
first type.</p>

                    <p>"This is just the beginning," Margie exasperated, "Why do you have to be so
glum Gerald, talking about us like we've been together for years," her fists
rest on her hips as she stares at him, her face holding back a slight grin.</p>

<p>"Hey! I'm just telling you the mistakes we'll probably make together." His
sheepish smile bores unbearably into her resisting smile, "I mean, our kids
are probably going to be lunatics--"</p>

<p>"No... the only lunatic in our family, that is if we have a family together,
is you smart guy. Our children are going to be happy and perfect."</p>

<p>Gerald kicks at a passing sand castle and shivers for a moment as they both
look up to see the last sliver of the sun blink out. "Well, I guess there's no
hope for them being depressed freaks like me then," he pulls her a little
closer so she can feel his body shake against hers.</p>

<p>"That's why I love you Gerald... because I think your a depressed-- are you
cold? Its seventy five degrees out here Gerald!" she says with a worrying
glare.</p>

<p>"You can continue, I believe you were about to explain the real reason your
still with me after a world record, five dates--"</p>

<p>"Well firstly I wouldn't call them dates," her hands tickle his side
aggressively, " You haven't spent a dime on me, and secondly, yes, I already
have Guinness on the phone," She puts her pinkie to her chin and her thumb to
her ear, "Wait, there telling me they don't believe me, they want us to wait
right here until their camera crew arrives." He slides his hand from her far
shoulder slowly up the arch of her neck, and steps abruptly in front of her
putting their faces only inches apart. He lets her feel his warm breath on her
lips, but then moves up and gives her a soft peck on the nose. "Your such a
tease Gerald," she places both of hands on his chest softly, leans in as if to
give a kiss and then pushes him firmly away. He trips and falls backward the
heals of his palms dig into the the soft sand. He looks up at her with a huge
grin on his face and grabs her by the leg and pulls her down with him.</p>

                    <p>I've been camping by the ocean for too long. <br />
The sand's cracked my feet and the sun's too hot. <br />
It's epiphany, not love, that ties me to the bedpost <br />
It was my dreams that tightened the knot, <br />
I can't stop.</p>

<p>I finally found what has been keeping men and women apart, <br />
Its that line between them on signs for restroom doors, <br />
I peeled one off while grinning in symbolic satisfaction, <br />
God patted me on the back and parentally shook his head.</p>

<p>I am an Astronaut, <br />
Wasted on vodka a billion miles from the earth. <br />
The government tells me I failed the Rorschach ink blot <br />
I told the doctors I saw two men holding hands.</p>

<p>I think a penny is all I need to pay back my debt to you, <br />
Understand it's more of a gesture, not to be thought of as quantifiable, <br />
I understand it may come off as a big "Fuck You," but thats up to you. <br />
You could choose to keep it and remember me always.</p>

<p>My perception of color is no longer what I was taught, <br />
I keep thinking blue when I see red, <br />
It's just not the same watching movies where people get shot, <br />
It all just looks... absurd.</p>

<p>Alright God, I name the last dumb animal "Zebra," where is my Eve?</p>

                    <p>I wonder when I will stop dreaming. I think I've got it. I have it. Now. <br />
I love the appearance of compounding sentences. They read like a mantra. Very
Soothing. Sweet. <br />
I wish that this blasted text box was created with the same width as my blog.
So as to preserve the formatting I carefully pay attention to. It's murder on
poetry. Everything askew.</p>

<p>I've always been a man for aesthetics. Someone thought me to be a talented
young artist once. The best in my class. The teacher thought I really had it
and offered to teach me privately. He was a nice old man. The whitest white
mustache. I heard he died. Six years ago I guess. Time flies. I think I had it
in my head that it was all luck though. That I was a fraud, and he would find
me out. I was scared I would loose my talent. Bloody fool. It was just natural
to me... it just made sense, didn't seam like there was anything special to me
at all. I was the only person in class who drew with perspective... meaning I
drew exactly what I saw, not what I thought was there. We did drawings in
class, of real objects... I remember I drew a stuffed penguin. I took it very
seriously then, I would ask people to switch seats with me so I could get the
perspective that showed the most depth. I was in fourth grade. I got scared
and then I quit. I didn't draw realism again for eight years.</p>

<p>I don't think I've thought about that in a long time. Let alone told anyone
that story. Years... many years. It's funny. I didn't even think about that
when I started drawing again. Not even once. Not until this moment.</p>

<p>My brother motivated me to become an artist and a writer. I respected him so
greatly. He was always the brilliant son, I always knew he was brilliant. He's
in Tijuana now, he called me. Why the fuck can't brilliant people just be
brilliant. Why can't they just shower the world with there talent. Why do
brilliant people have to get caught up in poisoning themselves, and second
guessing themselves and driving themselves insane. Why can't brilliant people
just be brilliant instead of killing themselves slowly so they can be just
another dumb sheep caught up in lies superstition.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is no goal I need to set for myself. I sorta always hated the
future. I think I'll just be brilliant, and not being afraid of choosing where
or how I'm brilliant. Just let myself be carried from one thing to the next. I
just want it to be natural. Organic. To bad I don't have the money for it. Got
to choose. Got to choose.</p>

<p>I miss my mom. I'm going to see her soon. I think she misses me. <br />
She use to say to me, "Michael your the light of my life."</p>

                    <h2 class='card-title'>Culture and Creation</h2>
                    <p class='card-text'><small class='text-muted'>May 16, 2008 at 02:30</small></p>
                    <p>There are many different kinds of culture. For a moment in my time at
Parkfield I made a connection in my mind, an epiphany if you please. "My
standard definition of culture is too narrow." I realized that any group of
people who shares traditions, has there own vocabulary, there own activity's,
or rituals could be described as having there own culture.</p>

<p>There are some forms of culture which occur on the micro scale that easily
escape detection. For example, sharing a traditional long walk to 711 and
passing a particular brand of cigarette back and forth is an element of
culture within a friendship. Culture can exist between just two people. There
are elements which are unique to that setting, there is vocabulary, method,
timing and tradition. There are cultures which are more obvious, cultures
which encompass ones way of life. I'd call these "enveloping cultures." I
don't know if it's a personality type, or if this is common to all human
beings, but I bask and glow in a new enveloping culture. I feel as if I am a
jungle explorer, discovering ancient temples or hidden caves beneath
waterfalls as I dive deeper as if for pearls within the depths of a new
culture.</p>

<p>To the outsider, enveloping cultures seem incredibly strange. In all
honesty... all culture is strange. Often times rituals seem arbitrary, with
older cultures the purpose behind certain rituals may have come and gone, they
still however serve to unite those involved. Culture provides a medium and
center for social creatures to interact, it often includes systems of
morality, and provides life purpose. Culture serves as a central set of social
rules for maintaining a balanced and healthy community. Even Micro-cultures
often serves to benefit basic needs.</p>

<p>As Family's have grow decentralized, and corporations seek more and more to
control our culture, the natural organic nature of culture has changed.
Corporate engineered culture has not grown out of years of benefiting the
community it served, it has grown out of capitalism and consumption. Science
has done it's fare share of dissembling culture, as many have turned away from
religion, and myth. These things once served purpose, served as outlets for
our emotional needs, and served as tools for guiding good choices. We exist in
a unique world where culture is as real as ever, but no longer existing
directly as a tool for our benefit.</p>

<p>The grandest thing I can imagine is creating an enveloping culture of my own.
I wish to discover a way to organically allow a new and unique culture to
blossom from my life. I think this not only takes a sense of openness, but a
fearlessness, and perhaps even a bit of recklessness. It takes the courage to
do new and strange things, and to lead others to engage in them as well. It
takes abandonment, in exchange for an embrace with what may be seen by
outsiders as absurd.</p>

<p>There are enough beautiful cultures in existence as it is. I realize I am
naive to seek to create my own so brashly having experienced so little. But I
want to become a participant in everything I respect, and I learn through
doing. This may be a weakness. Or this may be my place on this earth. I will
continue to respect, admire, and immerse myself in other cultures as much as
possible. But like an artist, or a writer, what better way is there to learn
then to practice your own creation while in the process of discovering and
learning from others works. I have myself decided to strive to create
tradition with those I care for, to invent new words, to pioneer new
perspectives!</p>

<p>Nothing would get done without naivety.</p>

<p>Where shall I start?</p>

                    <p>I've been lusting for a Wacom tablet for god knows how many years. It is
basically a pen and a writing pad that translates your motions and pen
pressure to the computer. In a wild foray into San Jose involving a several
hour tour through the guitar shops while my good friend Marc was searching for
a Les Paul guitar, of which his spending budget was a little over two-thousand
dollars, the only destination on my mind was my ex-work Best Buy. In my
scammings I had accumulated a large number of "RewardZone Points" from my
patriotic excess spending this last holiday season. A Nintendo Wii which I
resold, and the laptop I bought my parents ($299) for which they forcefully
paid me back. Unbeknown to them, with that laptop I happened to get a free HP
printer worth $79 which I kept, and a 4GB Microsoft Zune which I resold for
$100. Thanks Mom &amp; Dad, it was the best Christmas ever!. I also purchased a
large number of other toys which I played with, and returned before the
January 31st Christmas returns deadline. Buying things and playing with them
all Christmas long is the best and only kind of Christmas. You feel joyful and
exhilarated during and shallow and empty afterwards. Ahh, it seems I've
discovered a way to feel the joy and suffering of materialism without the
financial burden! The total expenses were in the ranges of $1k. My "Reward"
for all this tomfoolery came in the form of a $45 gift card, several months
later. Not much, but made me especially happy knowing I got it without
spending a dime.</p>

<p>People have weird fucking hobbies.</p>

<p>I could rant forever on this subject, so to make a long story short... I saw
they had an open box Wacom tablet ($169), I bartered with the manager, got an
extra $20 off, and walked out of there with my credit card $105 lighter ($199
- $50 - $45 = $105). I've been playing with it all night, and have been really
satisfied. Ominous as it seemed to me at first, it only took me about thirty
minutes to configure it in Linux! The clever little picture above, although
not spectacular, is my first sketch. Very cool.</p>

<p>Now not only do you get the joy of my poignant poetry, but my awful art as
well.</p>

                    <p>Oh music. I just watched a French film entitled "The Chorus." Obviously this
isn't its native title, it's the bastardized American translation of the
equally generic French title "Les Choristes." In reading the box, I found the
plot to be generic. Teacher goes to undisciplined students, they learn music,
students are reformed. Very predictable. I actually rented this movie
partially because that predictability is somewhat soothing. I was a great fan
of Mr. Hollands Opus, To Sir With Love, Dead Poets Society and many others on
that endless conceptual list. The lead male roles draw me in. They are
fathers, mentors, creators, dreamers and shape and blossom community's around
them in such a way that strikes me with awe. For the purpose of simplicity, I
will call these men Shepard's. Christian analogy's aside, this seems fitting.</p>

<p>I've grown quite fond of the Shepard. He is often takes the form of a clever
teacher who finds unique ways to reach his students. Naturally he is firm but
at the same time just and forgiving. He is charming, has a sharp wit, and a
distaste for authority. He need not be handsome, he may in fact be bald! He is
enamored with the success of his students, and perhaps a bit in the clouds,
often breaking the rules and treading on others feet on their behalf. He is an
ever vigilant father figure. In the movies he always has a weakness, usually
the unattainable woman, and it is in this you see his humanity. This however
is irrelevant. In the end. He does not get the girl. He rarely becomes renown.
He simply grows old quietly. His only legacy... the students he's touched.
This movie did not disappoint. Beyond another incarnation of my favorite
character, it reminded me of a time when I was in Symphonic band. Preforming
in a group of fifty individuals, all watching our director Ken Carter, who was
nearly one of those men himself. I realized at some point through the movie,
that this was type of man I wished to be. I realized at some point that this
is what I have always wished to be. A "Shepard".</p>

<p>I've come up with a word for people who posses characteristics I admire, or
seek. A person can become more then just a person, they can become a symbol
incarnate for idea or a dream. The essence of these individuals aspires beyond
there mortality. I have been referring to such individuals is "Avatars."
Avatar is most commonly associated with the Indian god Visnu. In Indian
culture an <em>avatāra</em> is the earthly form assumed by a deity. Hindu analogy's
aside, this seems fitting.</p>

<p>I have always been a stark individualist. Striving to succeed independently,
self taught. A part of me has a deep fear of becoming mealy an amalgamation of
my surroundings, and I've tried in the past years foolishly to cloister myself
in order to prevent my creations from being tainted. I believe I always knew
this was impossible, but still I avoided mimicry of others work and words,
even as a tool for learning. It has taken me many years to choose individuals
to look up to again. I once called these individuals hero's. I'm not looking
for hero's anymore. Hero's die. They're legendary for it. I'm looking for
human embodiments of concepts, Avatars. These individuals existence is
irrelevant, they are just collections of ideas and dreams. The process I have
gone through has made me realize what I am doing is probably not unlike what
our ancient ancestors did in there creation of Deity's. Ancestor worship is
the first recorded religion known, it only makes sense that after enough time,
the story's would begin to merge and individuals once renowned for one great
dead would take on those of others of his time. Eventually the story's would
be forgotten all together <br />
and become pure symbols, become myth. And so the first gods were born.</p>

<p>It has been odd watching my rational journey. Every day I look closer only to
see myself shifting to what I might call "empirical spiritualism." I don't
worship Avatars, but I do study them, spend great deals of time thinking of
them, and modeling my actions as I see them. In a sense this is a sort of
worship. I don't believe in Divine energy traveling through the cosmos to fuel
there deific (I think this word is a combination of Deity and Terrific!)
powers over the universe. But in a way that energy is real. Through my study I
become an Avatar myself, and in turn I influence those around me. I find
myself foolish yet again, realizing the grand enlightenment I build for myself
boils itself down to mere semantics ::Sighs:: At the same time I am proud. I'm
proud to have come to these realizations on my own, and I'm proud to feel I
know why I'm doing what I'm doing.</p>

<p>The Shepard is an Avatar I respect and wish to some day embody myself. It's
not about ego or self. It's about ideas, and dreams. That which is immortal.
Striving to become the embodiment of a concept is beautiful. In a sense it is
about letting go of the individual, the self, and dedicating your existence
towards something greater. It's not about the desire to change those around
you. Mahatma Gandhi, to me a is an Avatar of the Shepard, once said, "You must
be the change you wish to see in the world." I would add... "It is through the
strength of your embodiment, not your words that change will come." One need
not have heard, or even known a word Mahatma Gandhi said to feel the power of
his ideas, or dreams.</p>

<p>This is a dream worth striving for.</p>

<p>Wheres the naivety I was promised.</p>

<p>I just feel this listlessness.</p>

<p>Its akin to the sickness felt from laying in bed too long.</p>

<p>I love laying in bed... it takes me a really long time to feel like that.</p>

<p>Is this a lucid dream?</p>

<p>I crave. I crave so much. For something.</p>

<p>If that something is a perfect world,</p>

<p>Then as a creature of craving I do not belong.</p>

<p>Heres a lovely story written by several of the motivating aspects of my
rationality, they are personified as characters for your amusement.</p>

<p>Meaninglessness how is the soup? It doesn't matter? Really? I think it's too
hot. Time could you give us a hand with that. No rush, Desire depends on
anticipation. Pride mentions that perhaps there is something else we could be
accomplishing while waiting, but Fear doesn't want us to go too far, or the
soup may be cold when we return, Desire thinks of the taste of cold soup and
agrees.</p>

<p>Fuck the soup. Abandon smiles at me. Perhaps I should eat it now and burn
myself, Fear reminds me of the potential of permanent damage to my taste buds
and Desire turns his head and gives me a cold stair. Time whispers to Desire
the impossible to imagine length of tasteless living that would ensue, and
Desire looks resolute.</p>

<p>Fuck the soup. Abandon grins. I'll starve, I want to get the fuck out of here
and accomplish something. Pride reminds me of Jesus and we smile at each
other. Meaninglessness reminds me that anything I do won't actually matter,
Time mentions that in the grand scheme of things he agrees.</p>

<p>Fuck all of you. Abandon giggles. I sit down at the table and Time cools the
soup, Pride rearranges the floating noodle letters into a incomprehensible
word it made from the amalgamation of six other words, "Tidessireab" and
thinks he's amazing. Desire admires the temperature and texture of the first
bite, but then begins to rant on the improvements that could be made. Fear
wonders if the sodium content, and nutritional value of canned soups could be
potentially unhealthy. Meaninglessness just stairs out the window searching.
Abandon seems satisfied with the non-committal nature of the soup.</p>

<p>The letters around prides word are slowly consumed until only the word
remains. Pride can't bring himself to eat it, and goes to look for a pencil so
he won't forget the spelling. Desire goes to sleep on the couch seemingly
satisfied, but dreams of better soups.</p>

<p>Abandon pours the remaining tomato soup and the remaining letters into the
snow outside, he knows holding onto such things will only hold him back.</p>

<p>Pride is frustrated with Abandon and decides to write this story. Fear wonders
if others will interpret hidden meaning. Pride is sure everyone will love his
story. His ego and knowledge of his own genius motivates him to go out into
the snow and make a new friend,

<p>Love wanders around in the snow, so white and beautiful it blends perfectly
disappearing in the reflection of the sun. It's not alone, or lonely, it's
content knowing it has nothing to do with any of them. Nothing.</p>

<p>Abandon laughs and clicks "Publish Post."</p>

                    <p>I happened upon this amazing man. Henry Darger. Who wrote a 15,000 page novel
about seven beautiful little girls. <em>The Story of the Vivian G</em> <em>irls, in What
is known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinnian War Storm,
Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion.</em> Awesome title right! Anyway, this work
as well as hundreds of paintings some of which were 12 feet long painted on
taped together butcher paper were discovered in his room after his death. The
novel contains thousands of battles depicted in gory details, heroic rescues
and mysterious beasts! I watched a reasonably good documentary on him, they
animated sections of his work which I found a little inappropriate. As he
never intended his art to be viewed as such. In all reality he never intended
his art to be viewed at all, so I guess everything is up in the air.He was
declared a gifted reader when he was in first grade and bumped strait to
third, but then found himself shortly after in a boys institution for the
"Weak Minded." In his artwork and story he depicts the seven Vivian Girls as
the great heroins, and gives them dashing lines. In his auto-biography he
claims girls are far more courageous then men, and which in certain
circumstances I would agree with.</p>

<p>He had a very limited perspective on the world, and very limited experiences.
He lived his whole life as a janitor in a hospital, spent a short stint in the
military and as a Christian he attended mass every day (I didn't even know
mass happened everyday!). But he had a challenging relationship with god, as
was a vehement protector of children, he wished to adopt but was always
refused. God never answered his prayers. His war with God in the real world
takes its tole in the novel, as the Vivan Girls fight for the Christian army.
Whenever Darger has a dispute with God in the real world, the Vivian Girls
suffer horrible losses in there battles, or are nearly fatally wounded. His
knowledge of sex, and women was so limited, all of the females depicted in his
art possess the male genitalia!! He spent nearly every hour of his free time
working on the novel in some shape or form. He was a completely self taught
writer and artist, which I respect enormously! <br />
This man created such an elaborate world in his mind, he kept track of the
casualty's, the generals names and the expenses for the battles in a log
book.When he was finally put in the same elderly home his very own father had
died in thirty years before, he whithered and died very quickly. Without his
fantasy he had no reason to live.</p>

<p>The mind is capable of creating such amazing and elaborate worlds based on the
knowledge it at absorbs. My god... the mind is powerful.</p>

<p>Humans! Sometimes it's hard to believe I'm one of them.</p>

                    <p>"Faith."</p>

<p>This is my revised answer to any and all questions asked of me. It is an
answer not caught up in the unnecessary complexity's we impose on existence.</p>

<p>There are six streams of water in the center circle of my shower head, it is
surrounded by twelve further streams, and around that are an additional
eighteen. I imagine myself to look as a tiger while the streams spread the
hairs on my chest. Counting silences the mind. There must be people out there
who do this as hobby. Insomniacs. Those who think too much.</p>

<p>Insomniacs lay in bed and wonder deep into the night about reality. Planning
there next courses of action, questioning actions taken as so far. I dream
late into the morning, so late because the worlds I crate for myself can seem
so intriguing, complex and compassionate. I get caught in dreams and languish
lumbering out of bed.</p>

<p>I spend hours trying to remember... remember how I felt, and why I feel as I
do upon awakening. Sometimes I am overjoyed, and have no idea why. This slinks
into sadness. "Is my joy is rooted in another one of my fictional creations?"
They are mine so in hind sight I see no reason to lament. It can be
frustrating to forget... one can't turn their reality into what they can't
remember.</p>

                    <p>Congratulations. Despite the ambiguity of meaning within the stanzas, as a
whole your poem makes sense. It's a powerful collection of concepts.</p>

<p>It's a good start.</p>

it.</p>

                    <p>Must a critic be themselves criticized in order to be respected?</p>

<p>Poetry is like a drawing. You can spend hours making it perfect, like a
photograph. <br />
There are people who do this. Realists. <br />
I'm a realist.</p>

<p>Poems can be like abstract art too. All fucked up and random. Words and images
splashed on the page in hopes that the readers/listeners minds will find a
pattern. <br />
We're good at that.</p>

<p>Throw out enough words and a person can't help but find meaning. <br />
I've fallen for it.</p>

<p>Some abstracts capture a little bit of something real. <br />
You look at it and you can't quite see it. Maybe you can feel it. <br />
Maybe it comes to you when you look away.</p>

<p>What if I were to tell you that everything is the same? And everything is in
everything? <br />
What if told you in reading these lines backwards you'd find the meaning of
life? <br />
Would that scare or excite you?</p>

<p>Would you sit in denial of such simplicity? Would you demand a greater
challenge? <br />
Would you see everything crumble or everything come together? <br />
Would you see both?</p>

<p>Why don't old people burn themselves in front of the White House in protest to
war? <br />
Why don't their dieing breaths shout protest - wield the power of their
dwindling lives? <br />
Do they condone the existence they will soon depart?</p>

<p>Do they realize a greater meaning beyond war, hate, death, and pain, or do
they accept them? <br />
If I am who I am because of the world that has created me - am I not the
world? <br />
Why do we so often ask questions after and not before?</p>

<p>If I am everything, then I too am like a drawing. Perhaps I'm painted by a
realist. <br />
Perhaps I'm just a reproduction of what my artist has seen, and touched. <br />
A duplication. Or an amalgamation.</p>

<p>Or perhaps I'm a piece of abstract art. All fucked up and random. Just a
splash. <br />
Maybe I just think I'm something. Forcing patterns out of nothing. <br />
Maybe I've fallen for it again.</p>

<p>Or maybe I'm something between. Maybe I'm that little bit of truth in the
abstract. <br />
I can feel it, and I tense up, I look harder. What if I let my eyes loose
focus? <br />
Will I see me?</p>

<p>Perhaps it is easier to see truth in that which does not strive so hard to
reproduce it. Can truth be in deeper disguise within a fact, then in a lie?</p>

                    <p>I am king, <br />
Of a pond of perception <br />
Just large enough to see my reflection. <br />
I decree that someday I will be swallowed whole, <br />
And in time I'll become the sea, <br />
And eventually the stars.</p>

<p>In the mean time... <br />
For those who have no taste for my disgraces, <br />
I don’t have a kiss for those who condemn, <br />
Each has the taste of "me" on my lips... <br />
And it's a shame for you and them. <br />
I fan the flame.</p>

<p>When my lids lift, <br />
My color shall be gray. <br />
Gorge on illusions as you would chocolate, <br />
Fatten your self up, for the only thing thats pure white is a lie. <br />
But I can't bare to lavish life with ten foot long tongs. <br />
Truth is a masochists pleasure, <br />
It's spilled ink or a long sigh.</p>

<p>Does anyone fake an orgasm for themselves? <br />
I think I have. It made nickels and dimes at the time. <br />
Just to feel warm, wading in my placid pond. <br />
To Fantasize while I flail in a stormy sea.</p>

<p>We crack our eyes at sun break, <br />
And it dawns on us to 'Shake the chills.' <br />
But hand it to those who fall, or crawl from their beds for their own sake. <br />
To those of them who make a new notch on their belts for each day, <br />
And tighten it again, so it won't bleed dry. <br />
I say 'Bleed!' But out of passion, not fear. <br />
What good is blood without heart?</p>

<p>For those who are depressed, I understand. <br />
Just put faith in choice <br />
Beyond the buffet of distractions and highs, <br />
It's always been up to you. <br />
To choose to live, die, laugh or cry.</p>

<p>Smoke your life down to the bone if you wish, <br />
And feed your cancer bedtime stories, <br />
Of how it was. <br />
But don't tell yourself that’s how it had to be, <br />
Unless you are a lover with that lie.</p>

<p>Because we can be anything, <br />
Vegetarians if you please, <br />
And if you lust for brown lumps of ground beef... <br />
If that brings back comforts from your childhood. <br />
I will make you meatless meat balls. <br />
Just let our friendship be more, <br />
Then dining and deception.</p>

<p>I'd rather pry my eyes open every hour in this sea, <br />
Have salty stinging blurry sight so beautiful, <br />
I'll coddle the ocean cold with guilty grins, <br />
While waves crash like towers, <br />
Fearless because I've decreed:</p>

<p>I will be eaten, <br />
By a fish of many shades of gray. <br />
So I might serve beyond my words, <br />
And those I've touched holding hands in the swells.</p>

<p>My fish is more ominous then the ocean. And I will feed it well. <br />
I will swim in truth, <br />
Until my lie comes.</p>
