Not much to say about this one. Watch it. Its rough, but I'm improving... at
video editing that is. Learning is exponential. Everything builds off
everything else. The trick is finding where things overlap. This is video is a
sort of a mockery of this important concept. But... I love it anyway.

Until next video!
