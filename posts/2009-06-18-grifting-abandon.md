title: Grifting Abandon
---



While my responsibility drives,  
Shouting obscenities at passersbys,  
I'm in the back seat, window down  
Air surfing with my hand.

I'm ball dancing through a window,  
With a twist, our cupped hands made fist,  
We waltz through glass shards shimmering  
Air treading on obliviousness.

I've got mud on my helmet, bugs in my teeth,  
Built a pyramid of cars named Mona,  
Tearing monster truck tires up that staircase,  
Past heaven, into outer-space.

Forget coins in my eyes, currency is yet to be invented in this fantasy,  
The gate keeper best get himself a dictionary before the jury arrives,  
I'm a silver tongued lawyer for my soul,  
Grifting for just a few extra lives.

Faith regardless of incalculable odds...  
Hopes the most beneficial delusion I believe in,  
I'm surprised how often I surprise myself.
