There's no love at first sight for computer geeks. It use to be that a man
looked for a woman with a particular set of skills, that was generally
expected for all women to have, and a woman looked for a reliable man who
would work hard to earn money to raise a family. Even with these unfair gender
standards, people had a hard time finding the right person. Now lets ask
ourselves, how hard is it to find a girl who can write code in Linux? Because
that's an example of a set of skills I'd be interested in, and that represents
probably ten girls in California, none of which I would meet on the street.
Online dating is an inevitability for the nerd community. And from my
observations a potentially successful one. Congrats Brian & Leah! Love at
first type.
