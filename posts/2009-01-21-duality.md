If I'm to be between  
The world in my head.  
And the world as we collectively see it.  
So be it.

I've got a barefoot on the one foot,  
And I've a misfit tube sock too tight on the two foot  
What's mass-produced is too loose, or tight  
My mommy was only an assembly line for two.  
To me that's just right.

Princesses, popes, petty prim coats, and the past...  
Cut & pasting palaces round people, some with moats & crocodiles,  
Given enough time and glue, make-believe just never lasts...  
People put their hopes in odd places

We're so much more then we Play-Doh ourselves to be.  
Da Vinci might of got close though,  
I'm on the fifth shelf.  
Too short to reach myself.

I know with a camera zoom out to fit the size of existence,  
We may just be ten tin men setup in a row  
Just waiting for a finger to let us go  
I am the finger of my perception.

In my lucid dream's I've been granted god's hand  
Levitation, creation, the desires of anyman  
I've had a thousand tan brunets,  
Even... Triplets

My next challenge--a clone of myself  
Though facsimiles have been made, sentience alludes me  
Some part of me resists granting total control  
In due time, I'll summon this world of mine.
