It just sits there,  
in the corner.  
Huntched... curled into a shadow.  
In a black coffin.  
In a insane stupor, he cradled it  
Pieced it back to gather again  
Its golden body in his arms,  
Only to let it sing in ways he could not remember  
Notes falling daffidly failing with moments of udder bliss,  
A mixed concerto of rediscovery, failures and sucess,  
Its brilliance shined, and for a moment,  
Two were one.  
A gasp of release, and with a brief flurry of afterthoughts,  
It was in pieces again,  
With little absolute reassurances of return.  
And it sits, in the corner  
Again waiting for its memorance,  
To be struck on by insanity.  
Beautiful,  
If only, one could take on such bliss,  
While reasonable, and sane.
