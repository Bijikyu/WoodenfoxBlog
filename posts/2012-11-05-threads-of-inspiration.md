Carve out your places in life.

Burrow in the cracks and crevices where inspiration grows,

Open the mountains and mine the estuaries of thought and diligence reserved,

Catch the drifting threads.

Wind caught scents that swirl and catch, absorb and fill the dry,

Soak the thoughts that catch, clouds of mist that rise and leave one fresh in
worlds of white

These are dreams that catch, that feed and thrive,

These are the oligarchies of minds edge, tripping over forgotten sensations,
those that wake and lift.

Bottle them as fireflies, but care to feed, and free, and trust they will
return on winters and summers eve.

As the cold and the warm are simply coins of thought, which thrive on one
another.
