The experience which is NY.

I could recount the events of my trip, with poetic pondering, slightly exaggerated elaborations, and deliberated dissections. Instead I will write a fiction. Because inherently all perceptions are fictions, and every retelling is a recreation.

I was picked up at my doorstep by a ten foot tall mustached man driving a Benz built by Romans. This man had a mouth as big as he was tall and an array of skills to match. He felt like a victim from Los Angeles washed up and resuscitated on kinder shores. With dreams of movie sets, he bragged at his capacity to get things done, his grandest achievement, “Key Grip,” whatever that is. He was California. And as he smiled huge, gave me his card in hopes that someday my fame would cary him on the wave he’d been training to surf his whole life. I loved him. And as I waved goodbye to him, California waved back.

I’d go into the cavity searches which occurred while going through security, but I feel this is a trodden subject which has been over portrayed. So imagine for yourself the exaggerations you’ve heard a hundred times and lets move on.

As I sat waiting to depart, I searched the crowds for the “True New Yorker,” as I shall call him or her. I knew one must have been lured to the greener oceans of California and would be returning home on my same flight. The True New Yorker would be in a weakened state from the softening effect of this place, and would be ripe for capture. My eyes crawled out of my scull and wandered across the laps of strangers, my words slithering into ears in efforts to root out this creature. But as a social butterfly I was unsatisfied, and decided to introvert into my book at the thought of the ridiculousness of seeking something I would be immersed in shortly.

The sky over New York as you arrive in the night is like Gods private Light Bright set. Organized in grids of perfection which could only arise from years of destruction and recreation. It was an ocean that formed a net made of gold. In the midst I caught a glimpse of the ever so familiar red and blue drifting down the streets strobeing in majestic contrast. To save someones life? Or the hand of our Executive branch?

Upon arrival a generic foreigner, who classically described that his family would be coming shortly, drove me to the neon alter of corporate human sacrifice, “Times Square.” I was taken aback, and immediately felt subliminally compelled to purchase at least eighteen different products. I managed to escape my stupor and ascend to my room in the Quadruple Tree hotel only to be disappointed with my rooms height, looking out only 100 feet over the city. I ate the cookie I was given at the desk, quite a prize for a $300 room, and savored its freeness.

I wandered the streets, asking again, “Where was the true New Yorker?” Not here. Just idiots like me. I managed to find myself in back ally bars. The kind of bars where your back pressed against the wall, and your stomach was pinned to the counter. The kind of bars where newcomers crawled under the gauntlet of bar stools to find a seat. The drink was good. I just enjoyed, and listened. They must be here.

I opened my eyes only to find myself reading a sheet of typed notes. I was at Fox News? It was comfortable like a red harem filled with pillows, and as I read the lines I had spoken in my phone interview I thought to myself, “Shit… no wonder I’m here.” I knew the only person who could set the bar too high would be myself. I had no idea how to remember all the clever phrases I’d used. I instead took the famous phrase “be your self” literally, and decided to say “Fuck it, I’ll improve.” I’d put myself in the mind frame that everyone around me were mere peasants and with my fellow geeks shivering I had to be strong for us all.

There was one line in my head that I wanted to use, should the moment arrive. Sure enough it did. And it was the kicker of the whole show. I imagine as the moment took place a sign lit up for the audience saying “Boooooo” but they payed no regard and hooted and hollered over it. I even got her to wear my glasses.

After stealing several platters of egg burrito, I exited a champion. People looked authentically intimidated by me. I guess its dangerous to declare your disinterest in blond talk show hosts. But I felt the geeks had won. I thought it was absolutely important that everyone know, we have formed a geek dating site because we are superior, and don’t wish to waist our time with superficial blond talk show hosts.

I can see z’s escaping my head. To be continued…
