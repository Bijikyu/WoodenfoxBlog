It's the lion's choice  
It's Christmas  
Its color was brown  
It's my turn to drive  
Its tiny hand held mine  
It's the reason we're together  
We're alone finally  
Were you happy?

Just practicing my: it's / its / were / we're grammar. I was writing with
stream of consciousness, didn't realize it was a poem until much later.
