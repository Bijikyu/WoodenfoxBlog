Shall we dual with pistols or rapier Chaos?  
You load my dice and blow on them too! ::Swoon::  
How deceptive of you.

But you see... I'm too clever for you Chaos.  
You painted mask for primal law...  
Excuse for patterns I can't find.  
I am a abacus on crack, calculating my way through the earth to china-- given
enough time.

I'm twenty three years into my Mona Lisa,  
Done it all so far with my own hair.  
The true finesse was done with the beard I only this year learned to grow.  
A few horse hair brushes would have been nice-- and a real canvas,  
But Mona Lisa would practically paint her self with those tools.

I know myself like a tired lover,  
Who knows his partners thoughts before his own.  
Sometimes I just look at myself knowingly, and don't say anything at all.
