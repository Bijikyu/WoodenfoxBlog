We connoisseurs of fantasy  
Who dress in different destinies and dreams  
How we love to...  
Imagine.

Myself is only tangible  
With four fingers  
Clinging to the cliff of identity  
My mirror, memories  
And reflections in others eyes

One finger fatigued  
Reaches bent broken to the air  
Wind brushes across  
Whispering truths and lies  
To the persisting four:

You can become anything,  
Now two flail towards the sun.  
You're what you believe,  
A claw mark is left behind.  
Options are infinite,  
A puff of dust. Only one clings.  
You can never loose yourself,  
My body tumbles through the air.

When I meet someone new  
Through them I'm self aware  
Not of my immaculate illusion,  
But who I've become.

While I and those I love have held four fingers  
Firmly pressing my actions to fit  
Sun warped puzzle pieces of previous perception  
And fantasize finding ourselves finished  
Some day.

In a world where the inanimate is alive  
And people are never the same  
We pretend the river is still.  
Perhaps we're less malleable then my mind believes  
But believing is better  
Perhaps.

If there is no end to my fall  
Am I doomed or have I discovered?  
How it feels to fly.  
To brace or embrace oneself.
