I just saw Michael the Archangel, and was incredibly moved… I’ll cheat and steal a picture by someone else to give you an idea of how fucking awesome this is.I’ve always had a soft spot for Angels with swords, that I happen to be named after. I was sitting in Starbucks trying to remember the name of the church its in front of and asked an old Jewish guy next to me. He said, “Ya, I know what your talkin’ about, its Saint Johns Cathedral, Michael’s got his foot on ‘you know who’s head,'” For anyone who’s familiar with the representation, you’ll like what he added on here at the end. “You know who… George Bush.” This makes me love New York even more. I’ve been shooting the shit with locals this whole trip and I have to admit, they’re fucking great.

I was on TV today. Since I don’t watch TV, I was able to watch through the wonders of the internet, you can watch the segment below. I admit I was a little nervous, but not nearly as much as Joyce who did great by the way (She had no idea they were going to play the montage at the beginning about her, surprise!). I had to be brave to inspire geek courage amongst my fellows. I find this is usually when I’m the most brave. Below is a picture of the people we worked with. The girl on the far right is the producer, next Dan the guy who proposed and organized the segment, followed by the cute couple from Wisconsin (we went to the Nintendo World store, and gorged on pizza afterward), then theirs Joyce on the end.
My ego couldn’t help but cut and paste this blurb Joyce wrote on her blog:

“Then I met Mike from Santa Cruz. He was handsome, funny and had awesome green sneakers. Effortlessly he epitomized everything we love about geekdom. I guess that is why they picked him. People kept saying to him….you won’t be single long! I certainly hope that is true. 🙂 … Mike was just the right amount of smart/smartass. I love him. ” ~JoyceWell… anyway, here’s the shit you’ve been waiting for. Funny thing is, this part of the trip was probably the least exciting part: The segment!I’ll figure out how to get this posted on my blog when I get back, and I’m not in the best city on earth.
There’s a ton more I have no time to describe about my trip, and sadly there will be no pictures to share. I need to hire a bard to travel with me and log my epic journeys in song. More to come. Tonight is the CouchSurfer slumber party on Long Island, lets hope I can navigate the Subways all the way there!
